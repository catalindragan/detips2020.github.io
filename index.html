All submissions must follow the original LNCS format (http://www.springeronline.com/lncs) with a page limit of 18 pages (incl. references and well-marked appendices) for full papers. We may accept a number of short papers with a page limit of 6-8 pages. Authors should indicate if they would agree for their paper to be considered a short paper. Accepted papers will be made available during the conference. At least one author per paper must register and present at the workshop.
